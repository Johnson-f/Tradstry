This is the Next.js frontend for Tradistry.

**Tech Stack:**

*   Next.js
*   React
*   TypeScript
*   Tailwind CSS
*   Shadcn/ui for components

**Development Guidelines:**

*   **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Do not write custom CSS files.
*   **Components:** Reusable components are located in `components/`. UI components are in `components/ui` and are from Shadcn/ui.
*   **State Management:** Use React hooks and context for state management. For server state, use a library like React Query or SWR if needed (check `package.json`).
*   **Linting & Formatting:** Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing.

*   Keep code clean, readable, and well-documented.
*   Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
*   Follow existing project structures and coding conventions.
*   Follow proper best practices.
*   Explain technical decision in plain English.
*   Clean up unused code instead of leaving it "just in case".
*   If something looks confusing, add a comment explaining why you did it that way.
*   Fix type errors immediately rather than working around them.
*   Never use 'any' type unless absolutely necessary with documented justification.
*   Do not ignore or suppress Typescript errors - focus on clean, passing code.
*   Eliminate any redundant or speculative elements.
*   I am using Typescript across all projects i work on.
*   Rigorously apply DRY and KISS principles in all code.
*   Deliver optimal, production-grade code with zero technical debt.
*   Identify potential issues in the code and suggest actionable fixes.
*   Always striveto produce high quality, production-ready code that adheres to
    modern development principles. 
*   If the task is unclear, ask clarifying questions.
*   Prioritize clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
*   Generate concise, actionable responses that minimize disruption to the developer's workflow
