{"input": "Trade Summary: Ticker: SNAP. Entry: $10.00, Exit: $10.07, Stop Loss: $9.75 (-2.5%). R/R: 0.28, P/L: +0.70%. Entry Tactic: Inside Day, Edge: Relative Strength. Entry Rationale: I bought because it reclaimed its 200-day EMA and entered off the inside day after reclaiming. Exit Rationale: Sold because of emotions, was emotional about BULL. Emotional State: Calm entering, emotional exiting. Lesson: Never make a decision out of emotions again.",
